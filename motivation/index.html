Or why our donations to Ukraine mostly do not help civil Ukrainians like it should, but instead, conflict only have escalated almost all over the world? Or, might be you are asking yourself why there are so many talks about Ukraine but things go only worse and now not only Ukraine could be emerging from a humanitarian catastrophe?</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>I am writing this text because believe that some help, some hope is needed in this world now, and might be you have similar thoughts. Anyways - I am grateful that you are reading this, spending your personal time.</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Before I start - I want to add a note to this text and the idea that stands behind it: <i>every thought, every word, phrase, or sentence in this text is faced against war, discrimination, and any conflicts escalation. This is a peaceful, non-military, apolitical, and non-governmental text.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></i></span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">I live in a mostly peaceful Europe. Just an ordinary man: working for a living, meeting with my friends when there is such possibility, and missing my family if we are not in contact for a while.</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">I grew up as a person of the world, like most of my generation, considering that our world is united and all wars are in past and we should, we will build a better world together. No matter where we were born, no matter what race we are, no matter what gender, nation or religion we are because matters only what we do. Giving help to one human who needs help or to the whole of mankind, depends only on the situation and our possibilities. We are what we do, not how we look or what language we speak.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">We all had these COVID years. During this time we were burned out emotionally, had financial problems, or even fought for our own life. We started to forget how is it to communicate closely every day and how we helped each other, cooperated, and tried to create something better together. That influenced also the mood in society and international economical relationships.</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">As a result in the background of that, during last years, various internal commotions started: USA, China, Canada, Australia, UK, Europe, Russia. On the base of these commotions, a lot of freedoms were taken away, and the whole world started to divide into regions. More of that, our privacy was taken away and thoughts started to be polarised and aggression was escalated. What was even worse - our leaders from all sides of the world became greedier and even more aggressive.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Now there is the war in Europe.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Personally, for me it became a mindset change moment - never before I have looked in the eyes of war so close. In Ukraine live some of my friends and family members. With some of them, I have a contact and I am listening to what they are going through during the last month and trying to help, with some others (elder people) I have had no contact at all for a long time now… I do not know how they are now, where are they, are they still alive…</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">And the worse part of this is that I am not alone in that situation - tens of thousands of families over the world faced the same situation. Global economical organizations already predict more than 5 million Ukrainians to become refugees. Some families are luckier than others and after some time they unite with their family members, no matter where. Others are helpless and are still waiting and hoping that everything will be fine - but regarding myself, I can not stand still and silent any more.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Even if I can do nothing now with my situation, at least I want to try to help others, because things will not become better without our global mindset change to become more peaceful, friendly and cooperative like we were before.</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">For now, it seems that world leaders want war, provoke, are being provoked, and are not able to communicate peacefully. I regret to say it, but it seems that now we are starting to re-enter the era of conflicts and humanitarian catastrophes, and most likely that is not the last war/humanitarian catastrophe we have. And this fact influences all society via the media, our society is being polarised - you are for A or you are for B, no other options are given. Sorry social networks, sorry media and leaders, but I am for H - Humanity.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Trying to get information about the local situation in the Ukraine regions, where my family members live, I have faced propaganda, lies, and censorship from all sides of the war.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>None of the war sides provided correct information, but I was able to contact multiple regular local people who helped a lot to find out the real local situation and even tried to help me directly. I thank them all.</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">As I mentioned I am a man of the world - I have friends in the USA, UK, China, Japan, all over the EU, in Israel, Ukraine, and Russia… And I communicate with them a lot during last weeks. One day some of them could not make a call to each other, because the communication channels were already blocked. Some of my friends speak no more to each other because of world polarization and conflict escalation in societies. And some of them wonder what happened to their countries:</span></p><ol class="ol1"><li class="li2"><span class="s1">My friends from Ukraine showed me how a Russian tank is driving by the place where I and my grandfather loved to have a walk in my childhood and he also showed how Ukrainian Forces placed artillery canons in the schoolyard, where we played with him a football, 250 meters away from the place he lived, using that building full of civilians as a shield. They tell me how dangerous it became to stay on the streets because local criminals got weapons and how hard is it to find some food and water safe to drink.</span></li><li class="li2"><span class="s1">My friends from Russia tell me how some specific medicines curating serious illnesses started to disappear, how Russians are being banned from international cooperation organizations, being abused on the web, being detached from crucial technologies and scientific exchange, being attacked via open-source projects with harmful code and are abandoned by all the rest of world. Sanctions do not hit leaders, they hit civilians.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></li><li class="li2"><span class="s1">My friends from the USA tell me that there is a fear in the air about future days and they got sanction payback bill too - some basic products are being missed here and there, prices rise. They are not guilty that leaders cannot be peaceful.</span></li><li class="li2"><span class="s1">My friends from Germany tell me how the prices of everything grew up in a moment. Recession and astronomical prices influence them too, even more, severe than in the USA and he is afraid that if nothing will normalize and prices will grow higher, next winter he might face a dilemma about what to pay for: fuel, food, or heating… They have not chosen a life like this by themselves.<br><br></span></li></ol><p class="p1"><span class="s1"><i>It looks that something wrong is going on globally…</i><br><br>What is being done to care for regular civilians all over Europe or any place in the world? Which countries or leaders helped elder people, women, and children, wounded or sick civilians in Ukraine? Not with guns or money for weapons, but with direct help on place to civilians. The answer is almost none - during last month most of the real humanitarian help came from regular people or a few humanitarian organizations and I thank everybody who instead of taking a gun, tries to save all lives by giving helping hand with bread and blanket.</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">As I mentioned before our world started to polarize some time before this war. International organizations during last month showed that they became too politicized and cannot work together. UN, OSCE, COE - nobody helped, they only escalate conflicts.</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Unfortunately, nowadays most of the leaders we have chosen (or did not) do not see the whole picture or just ignore it because of own interests - all parts of our planet are closely interconnected, we all depend on each other even if we do not notice that in everyday life. Our economies, ideas, and souls already cannot exist without our friends and rivals. I do not know if some leaders just do not understand that fact or ignore it because of their greed, want to put personal interests over humanity, or their weaknesses, but as a result, we got global problems that will not disappear if we will continue to escalate conflicts, divide societies and brake all economical connections that were built by our fathers.</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">NATO, USA Leaders, Russian leader, and some European leaders -<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Instead of helping people in the place, they emerged sanctions that already struck back to USA and EU economies, and every day most of the leaders are trying to escalate conflict adding more gasoline to the fire by their statements and actions.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong><i>So what we got now:</i></strong></span></p><ul class="ul1"><li class="li2"><span class="s1">Sky-high inflation level that only started its run (Eurozone 10%+). As a result, 2022 could become a starting point for the next recession (in a worse scenario even crisis) because all economical connections now are being broken by politics, not ordinary people. Instead of cooperation and sending funds/food to people, we use sanctions that burns money and makes civilians all over the world to suffer.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></li><li class="li2"><span class="s1">Humanitarian catastrophe after the war ended.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I already mentioned that 5+ million people will become refugees and potentially homeless. They need place to stay, food to eat and they have no possibilities to take care of themselves for now.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></li><li class="li2"><span class="s1">Our sanctions raise prices for gasoline, grain, wheat, garden fertilizers and as a result, all prices grew up and will do that if we will not stop dividing the world.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></li><li class="li2"><span class="s1">That leads to a 20% price rise for food staff over current prices in developed countries as optimistically UN predicts. Starvation in poor countries can become the nowadays norma again (in the list of biggest exporters of wheat in the world are Russia, Belorussia, and Ukraine). Millions of people that were not involved in that war will be starving because our leaders act before thinking. Sanctions strike in the hardest way the ordinary people, not leaders. That is we who buy less food, partly tun down heating not.</span></li><li class="li2"><span class="s1">Censorship and propaganda became the new norma (what a shame)</span></li><li class="li2"><span class="s1">Some nazist and other radical movements are rising again (because are being supported financially now)</span></li><li class="li2"><span class="s1">Talks about chemical weapons</span></li><li class="li2"><span class="s1">News about biological weapons</span></li><li class="li2"><span class="s1">New “Iron Curtain” is starting to be built<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></li><li class="li2"><span class="s1">And last but not least - talks about potential Nuclear war…<span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span><a href="https://thebulletin.org/doomsday-clock/current-time/"><span class="s2">@Doomsday clock<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></a>- Just a thought, might be we should set that we are already 90 sec before The Self-destruction Midnight, not 100s like we were in 2020…<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></li></ul><p class="p1"><span class="s1">This list is not what can be named success and I am afraid it all can be checked as completed in one day… And in that case, the help will be needed not only by Ukrainians but by people from multiple countries. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">I do not believe in leaders or countries anymore, I believe only in mankind,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>humanity. Unfortunately, I cannot stop leaders from making bad decisions. But we can try to make the best of a bad situation, to smooth the consequences of their decisions. Some of us already tried to help by donating to charity and humanitarian organizations.</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">To be said - there are some humanitarian non-governmental organizations, that still care for all people - humanity, without distinguishing between Us and Them. And I will try to continue to support them because most of them do not talk about peace with guns in their hands, but on the contrary lend a helping hand with a meal, water, and blanket in it, giving it to those who need it the most.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Peace and prosperity can only be succeeded by carrying about each other, not by provoking further aggression. We all together might carry each other and in cooperation push towards science and even colonize other planets, but instead, we are trying to blow up the only planet that has life on it…<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">1. That is why we need a mechanism that could in the future stabilize and heal that harmed regions. If something really bad happens, it could forward money flows to fix what was broken.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">I believe in people and here could be named some of the Non-military Humanitarian organizations that we donate to, right now. Unfortunately, the situation here is not so bright too - some of them are influenced by certain countries, by other organizations, or in a lot of cases, swindlers use their names to get funded. From multiple sources, I got information about fake-charity schemes that have grown and multiplied during the last month. This leads to the fact, that a lot of kind people, willing to help were sending money to newly formed fake-charity funds/wallets and that is one of the ways radical forces, terrorists and just usual swindlers get funds used to buy more weapons (not only in Ukraine…). Some terrorist organizations receive money from fake-charity bank accounts and fake-charity crypto wallets.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Even pretty big and well-known charity organizations do not use the funds as they should. Recently one of the biggest charity organizations in my country provided information on what received funds were spent for, and it turned out that less than 30% of donations were spent on pure humanitarian purposes, all the rest was used to buy close to military equipment.</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">2. So we are faced with another problem - the need for the credibility of charity/donation organizations. At least for me, this is one of the key questions because weapons must not be bought using donated funds. We need a trustful address for our donations that will be able at least to guarantee that received funds will be sent only to the proven non-governmental humanitarian organization(s), to the neediest places on the Earth.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Also, we should keep in mind that this address should be able to send money when it is needed. At this moment, funds should be spent to help local people in Ukraine, but in future cataclysms like tsunamis or earthquakes, technogenic catastrophes like Fukushima nuclear disaster, and wars that could take place in other regions funds must be sent to cover suffered region’s basic needs.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">3. That means we need the mechanism, that could accumulate funds automatically, without waiting for donations, to start helping regions ASAP.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The mechanism should be built on the base of the existing markets.</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">4. Also, that means that fund movements should be crystal clear for anyone and publicly available for personal audits. In that way, the existing banking structure is not suitable because of the lack of transparency for all transactions.</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">From the above stated, we have 4 criteria for this global mechanism:</span></p><ol class="ol1"><li class="li2"><span class="s1">It should be humanity cantered, versed to help those who need it the most.</span></li><li class="li2"><span class="s1">It should be trustworthy.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></li><li class="li2"><span class="s1">It should be automatic.</span></li><li class="li2"><span class="s1">It should be fully transparent.</span></li></ol><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Criterias 1. trustful and 2. humanity cantered, could be hard to succeed standing alone. But I hope I will find some outstanding person that will become the ambassador of this donation mechanism and will take over responsibility for all out-coming payments and will inform in an open and public way to whom funds were sent, when and how much. I would prefer not to be responsible for finances (will concentrate on the development process for that mechanism), but till the moment I will find the right person I will make those payments by myself and it is planned to send them to RED CROSS as one of few humanitarian organizations, who helps Ukrainian people now.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Criterias 3. automatic mechanism and 4. full transparentness banns existing banking system (it is not transparent at all and being managed by people with own emotions and interests), but those can be succeeded using crypto-technologies. Standing alone for now I have no sufficient funds and time (help to Ukrainians was needed yesterday) to form a development team and develop the DeFi system we need (for sure it will depend on if the idea will be supported by you), plus it is a huge work that is needed to be done only in the right and secure way. I am planning to do this in the future, but for now, another solution is needed.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">I continued to search for a solution and got an idea that this project could be started with NFTs that would use one credible crypto-wallet to collect NFTs royalties. First of all, it matches all 4 base criteria, and more of that I will be able to use crypto technologies in a variety of forms and might be create some symbol of cooperation that way, and that could be noticed by some of the leaders.</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Royalty fee will be set from 10% in the case when NFTs that will be bought on OpenSea (@OpenSea - if you want to help this project - please rise max royalty on your marketplace up to 25%) and up to<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>25% in the case when we will buy and sell this NFTs on Rarible NFTs Marketplace. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">In that way, every buying or selling action with these NFTs will increase the funds raised for humanitarian purposes like help to Ukrainians (or other nations in the future) to build back their lives. This instrument could be also used in the future repeatedly to fulfill the fund again in case of any humanitarian catastrophes. During last years, some NFT collections got an overall turnover of over 1 billion US dollars. 25% from a billion is 250 million US dollars - would not be bad to get this money converted into humanitarian activities, not in yachts and I believe, that we together can achieve results we could be proud of.</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">This is the way how we could, as I see it, we could get some more warranties that our donations will reach their destination and will be spent to save some lives and make some crying children have a smile back on their faces.</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Might be our leaders are willing to make war or just do not realize what they are doing, but we are willing peace and<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I believe that all together we are able to at least help those people that will stay after wrong decisions.</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">For sure this is the only first generation of this idea and I cannot predict the future, but I will continue this project. Current NFT collections that were already created will not be extended, but I will continue developing the idea and technical realization and the second generation, which will be a step forward in technology (Dynamical NFTs), fundraising, and generative art directions.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">So this project is my way - ‘<strong>Tiny Riot</strong> against all wars, lies, and violence, that I see now, and for cooperation, dialog, and mankind itself.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Once, I hope to become a witness of a moment when human beings will land on Mars for the first time and demonstrate that humanity is capable to work together in peace, not the moment our planet will become similar to Mars now - with no life on it, lonely and hard to survive. But for now, I have a lot of work to do.</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">And what is your choice?</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">TR</span></p></div><footer><div class="post__tags-share"><aside class="post__share"><a href="https://twitter.com/share?url=%23PUBLII_RELATIVE_URL_BASE%23%2Fmotivation%2F&amp;via=%40TinyRiotReal&amp;text=Motivation%20x" class="js-share twitter" aria-label="Share with Twitter" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg><use xlink:href="./../assets/svg/svg-map.svg#twitter"/></svg> </a><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/sharing/share-offsite/?url=%23PUBLII_RELATIVE_URL_BASE%23%2Fmotivation%2F" class="js-share linkedin" aria-label="Share with LinkedIn" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg><use xlink:href="./../assets/svg/svg-map.svg#linkedin"/></svg> </a><a href="https://api.whatsapp.com/send?text=Motivation%20x %23PUBLII_RELATIVE_URL_BASE%23%2Fmotivation%2F" class="js-share whatsapp" aria-label="Share with WhatsApp" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="./../assets/svg/svg-map.svg#whatsapp"/></svg></a></aside></div></footer></div></article></div></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__social"><a href="@TinyRiotReal" aria-label="Twitter" class="twitter"><svg><use xlink:href="./../assets/svg/svg-map.svg#twitter"/></svg></a></div><div class="footer__copyright">TinyRiot: launched on April 15, 2022 | This webpage is hosted on IPFS (InterPlanetary File System)</div></footer><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = {
